# Quarto

I recently found out this code that i did when i was in university. 
Then I wanted to test if it would run on visual studio out of the box and since it did
I decided to :
1. Refactor it a bit
2. Remove useless code.
3. Improve the user interaction (basically make it more foolproof).

I decided to upload the code in case it was useful to someone.

This code is basically an AI that plays Quarto. Using either a [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) 
or an [AlphaBeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
